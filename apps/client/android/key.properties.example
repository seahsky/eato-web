# Android Release Signing Configuration
# =====================================
# Copy this file to 'key.properties' and fill in your actual values.
# IMPORTANT: Never commit 'key.properties' to version control!
#
# This file is required for building release APKs and App Bundles
# for Play Store deployment.

# =============================================================================
# GENERATING A KEYSTORE
# =============================================================================
# Run this command to generate a new keystore file:
#
#   keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA \
#     -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-key-alias
#
# You will be prompted to:
#   1. Create a keystore password
#   2. Enter your name, organization, and location info
#   3. Create a key password (can be the same as keystore password)
#
# IMPORTANT: Store your keystore file and passwords securely!
# If you lose them, you cannot update your app on the Play Store.
# =============================================================================

# The password for the keystore file
# (Set during keystore generation)
storePassword=your_keystore_password_here

# The password for the signing key within the keystore
# (Set during keystore generation, often the same as storePassword)
keyPassword=your_key_password_here

# The alias name for your signing key
# (Set during keystore generation with -alias flag)
keyAlias=my-key-alias

# Path to your keystore file (relative to the android/ directory)
# Example: If your keystore is at android/my-release-key.jks, use:
#   storeFile=my-release-key.jks
# Or use an absolute path:
#   storeFile=/path/to/my-release-key.jks
storeFile=my-release-key.jks
